        <h2>About me</h2>
        <h3>My name is Nadire. I'm from Turkiye. My preferred pronouns are she/her. I was a primary school teacher in
            Turkey. I love doing things that benefit children. I am taking this program because I want to make
            illustrations for childrenâ€™s books. I am also interested in digital media and design. I hope to increase my
            skills digitally with this course.</h3>
